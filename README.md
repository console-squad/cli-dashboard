# CLI Dashboard

The CLI Dashboard was developed by the console squad as a 24 hour Dynatrace Innovation day project. The purpose of this project is to learn how to display dynamic data in the terminal with a nice styled interface. Our examples include Dynatrace metrics and covid data right in your terminal, so you can always feel like you're JP from Grandma's Boy (2006).
